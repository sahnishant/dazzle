# MyDazzle Site Improvement TODO

---

## I. Visual Appeal & Branding

- **Logo:**  
  The "MyDazzle" text logo is simple. Consider adding a distinct visual mark or icon for stronger brand recognition.

- **Hero Imagery (Homepage):**  
  If you have a true homepage (e.g., `mydazzle.netlify.app/`), add a strong hero banner showcasing your best pieces or current promotions with a compelling Call to Action (CTA).

- **Product Photography – CRITICAL:**  
  - **Consistency:** Use a consistent background, lighting, and angle for all main product shots for a professional look.
  - **"Dazzle" Factor:** Jewelry photos should sparkle and look irresistible. Use professional lighting or learn techniques to capture shimmer and detail.
  - **Multiple Angles & On-Model Shots:** Show products from different angles. For earrings, necklaces, and rings, on-model shots help customers gauge size and appearance.
  - **Lifestyle Shots:** Include a few lifestyle shots (e.g., someone wearing the jewelry in a nice setting) to enhance appeal.

- **Color Palette & Typography:**  
  The current palette is neutral. Ensure fonts and accent colors reinforce a "dazzling," elegant, or modern feel.

- **Favicon:**  
  Present and good!

  - **Image Gallery:** Use a carousel or thumbnail strip for multiple images.
